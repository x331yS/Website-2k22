    <h1>Aris Project</h1>
    <h2 id="language_" class="h2_one">As the world aimed to conquer Mars, Elon Musk approached the goal by
        2022. Mars seemed to carry... but its work was not successful. Despite the
        technologies put in place and the efforts made, it was impossible for humanity to
        tread the soil of Mars.
        It was then that a group of motivated, talented and thirsty engineers
        discoveries, have developed the technologies allowing access to the planet
        March.
        These engineers brought together founded the company Aris. They have, together,
        conceptualized and implemented the technologies necessary for the journey to the
        planet Mars. The technologies have been advanced and achieved and have enabled different
        modes of travel to Mars.</h2>
    <h2 class="h2_second">Mars opens its doors to you
        was their slogan, and Aris was born. Derived from the name of the Greek god “Ares”, the journey
        to Mars was now possible for humanity. Aris allows even more.
        Today a powerful company, Aris is implementing a strategy of
        development of tourism on the red planet. Humanity is thirsty for discovery, and
        Aris will satisfy this craving.
        Their strategy?
        Allow everyone to be able to explore Mars, discover and set foot on the ground of a new
        planet, to feel the difference of setting foot on another star.</h2>
